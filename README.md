### Project 3 - What would a house in Apex, NC sell for now?

Sub question 1: Is there a better time of the year to seel my house?
Sub question 2: Can we forecast home prices in Apex for 2021?


### Problem:
1. Dataset: MLS Triangle Area
2. What ML approach(es): Used tensorflow sequential becuase our number of predictors
and need for a numerical outcome as opposed to a categorical.
  * Chose MSE to measure our loss because it was predictive
  * Built two models, one for single family homes and one for townhomes.
